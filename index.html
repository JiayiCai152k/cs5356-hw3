                <h3>HTML Element Not Covered in Detail</h3>
                <p><strong>Q: What HTML element did I use that we haven't covered in detail?</strong></p>
                <p>A: I used the <code>&lt;details&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;summary&gt;</code> elements. These allow users to toggle additional content without needing JavaScript.</p>

                <p><strong>Q: What did I learn about its behavior?</strong></p>
                <p>A: By default, the content inside <code>&lt;details&gt;</code> is hidden until the user clicks on <code>&lt;summary&gt;</code>. This is useful for organizing extra information in a collapsible format.</p>

                <h3>CSS Property Not Covered in Detail</h3>
                <p><strong>Q: What CSS property did I use that we haven't covered in detail?</strong></p>
                <p>A: I used the <code>filter</code> property, which allows applying visual effects like blur, brightness, contrast, and grayscale.</p>
        
                <p><strong>Q: How did I use it?</strong></p>
                <p>A: I applied the <code>filter: grayscale(100%);</code> effect to my profile image when hovered over. This makes the image turn black & white smoothly. I also used <code>transition</code> to ensure a smooth visual effect.</p>

                    <h3>API Integration</h3>
                    <p><strong>Q: What API did I integrate into my website?</strong></p>
                    <p>A: I used the <code>Art Institute of Chicago API</code>, which provides access to artwork information from the museum’s collection.</p>
            
                    <p><strong>Q: How did I use it?</strong></p>
                    <p>A: I fetch a random artwork from <code>https://api.artic.edu/api/v1/artworks/search?q=cats</code> and display the artwork’s image and title on my website. 
                    A button allows users to load a new piece of artwork without refreshing the page.</p>
            
                    <p><strong>Q: What did I learn?</strong></p>
                    <p>A: I learned how to process JSON data returned by an API and extract useful information. 
                    I also learned how to construct an image URL using the museum's IIIF (International Image Interoperability Framework) system to properly display images.</p>
